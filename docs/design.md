## Designing a Complex Solution

Designing a complex software solution requires a meticulous and structured approach to ensure that all components integrate seamlessly and meet both functional and non-functional requirements. Combining the **SDLC** with **Agile Scrum** methodologies provides a balanced framework that accommodates structured planning while embracing flexibility and iterative development.

### Step-by-Step Design Process

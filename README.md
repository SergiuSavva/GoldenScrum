## Introduction

The software development landscape demands methodologies that are both structured and flexible. **SDLC** provides a systematic framework for developing software, ensuring each phase is meticulously planned and executed. **Agile Scrum**, on the other hand, offers an iterative and collaborative approach that accommodates changes and fosters continuous improvement.

By integrating SDLC with Agile Scrum, organizations can leverage the strengths of both methodologies, ensuring comprehensive planning while maintaining agility. Additionally, employing the **Golden Circle** framework enhances the clarity and purpose of each task, aligning them with broader business objectives.
